# blockchain_with_python

## A Quick Wallet Description ##

This code allows the user to send transactions in both test Bitcoin and Ethereum with the Python programming language. The private keys needed are read in via the getenv function to allow the private key to remain hidden. The rest of the code uses functions to bring in the necessary coin type, private key, account information, recipient address, and coin amount.
